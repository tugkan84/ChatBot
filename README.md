# Welcome to my Chatbot game
My name is Birkan Tugcu

If you want to send message or issue , you can use github issues. If you send hints, I would appreciate.    
Game is really easy just follow questions and try to enter exact words for best user experience. If you see empty screen just send a key and game will begin.  

If you want to work on your local environment : 
You can use git clone https://github.com/tugkan84/ChatBot.git for getting project. 

cd your-folder

npm install # installing the dependencies

npm start # or 'node .'

# I hope you like it
